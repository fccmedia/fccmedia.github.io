We still have a number of students who do not have access to a office suite either on their home Computer or their tablet device. So below I have put together an overview of the different software which is available to you.</p>

<h3 id="remoteaccesstofcc">Remote Access to FCC</h3>

<p>As of the beginning of November 2013, students have had access to the new Microsoft Remote Apps system. This system will successfully run on tablet devices and a range of browsers, from both inside the college and at home. </p>

<p>The Remote Apps system can be found by <a href='https://www.remote-felpham.co.uk/RDWeb' >clicking here</a> and following the instructions. The advantage of using this system is that you have access to your college workspace and a range of software you may not have access to at home i.e. Photoshop CS3. </p>

<h3 id="paidsoftware">Paid Software</h3>

<p><strong>Microsoft Office</strong> <br />
<em>Windows / Mac OS X</em></p>

<p>As part of the new Office 365, personal users can now buy a subscription of £5.99 a month or £59.99 per year. This subscription will allow you to install office on 1 PC or Mac, as well as 1 Tablet.</p>

<p>Alternatively you can sign up for the Office 365 subscription which is £7.99 a month or £79.99 per year. The advantage of the subscription is that it allows you to install office on up to 5 PCs or Macs, as well as 5 tablets.</p>

<p>Office 365 will provide you access to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Windows: Word, Excel, Powerpoint, Publisher, Access, OneNote and Outlook</li>
<li>Mac: Word, Excel, Powerpoint and Outlook</li>
</ul>

<p>By signing up to an Office 365 subscription you also gain an extra 20GB of OneDrive storage.</p>

<p><strong>iWork</strong> <br />
<em>Mac OS X / iOS</em></p>

<p>iWork is comprised of three main pieces of software: Pages, Keynote and Numbers, each of which received a major upgrade in October 2013. As well as being able to save your files in the native iWork format, you can also save in a Microsoft Office friendly format which makes it easy to continue working on a project on the college network.</p>

<p>iWork is available on:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mac: £13.99 each from the Mac App Store OR Free if you have purchased a new Mac since October 1st or own a previous version of iWork.</li>
<li>iOS: £6.99 each from the iTunes App Store OR Free if you have purchased a new iDevice since October 1st or own a previous version of an iWork app.</li>
</ul>

<p>Using iCloud all of your documents can by synced between your desktop and your mobile device (requires at least OS X 10.7 and iOS 6).</p>

<h3 id="freesoftware">Free Software</h3>

<p><strong>OneDrive</strong> <br />
<em>Windows / Mac OS X</em></p>

<p>By signing up to an OneDrive account as well as gaining 7GB of online file storage, you also gain access to an online version of Office. While this is a cut-down version of the full office software, it will meet most students needs and will allow you to create Word, Excel and Powerpoint files.</p>

<p>It is important to note that while all of your documents will be stored online, you can download a offline version of your files ready to submit to your teachers.</p>

<p><a href='https://onedrive.live.com/about/en-us/' >Click here to visit the OneDrive sign up page</a></p>

<p><strong>Google Drive</strong> <br />
<em>Windows / Mac OS X / iOS / Android</em></p>

<p>By signing up to an Google Drive account you will gain 15GB of online storage and the ability to create a Document, Presentation or Spreadsheet. While Google Drive exists entirely online, the range of features which is provided to the user is extremely extensive and will easily meet the needs of almost every user.</p>

<p>If you use Google Chrome as your browser if provides you with the ability to setup offline access to your files and documents. You can also download a Microsoft Office format version of your documents ready to submit to your teachers. </p>

<p>There is also a Google Drive app available for iOS and Android devices, while they do allow you to edit your documents they only provide basic functionality. </p>

<p><strong>iWork for iCloud</strong> <br />
<em>Windows / Mac OS X</em> </p>

<p>iWork Online is still classed as beta by Apple, so while there may still be some bugs to be ironed out, the range of functionality is extremely strong. All you need is an iCloud account which is available to anyone with an device running iOS 6 or higher. Any document you create in iWork Online is accessible via iWork on the Mac or iOS.</p>

<p>You can also e-mail a Microsoft Office format version of your document ready to submit to your teachers. Unlike SkyDrive and Google Drive, iCloud online IS accessible via the college internet.</p>

<p><a href='https://www.apple.com/iwork-for-icloud/' >Click here to visit the iWork for iCloud website</a></p>

<p><strong>OpenOffice 4.1 / LibreOffice 4.1</strong> <br />
<em>Windows / Mac OS X</em></p>

<p>OpenOffice is an open source office suite which provides a full range of different pieces of software including the ability to create documents, spreadsheets, presentations, drawings and databases. It allows for the user to save all of their files in a Microsoft Office format, however it is also worth noting that as of Microsoft Office 2010 all OpenOffice files types can be opened. </p>

<p>LibreOffice is an off-shoot of the OpenOffice project and offers many of the same features, along with the ability to open Publisher files. It is important to note that at the moment, you can only view Publisher files.</p>

<p><strong>Quickoffice</strong> <br />
<em>iOS / Android</em></p>

<p>Quickoffice is a free app for both iOS and Android, it allows you to open and edit Microsoft Office documents, spreadsheets and presentations. While it does require you to sign into a Google Drive account when run for the first time, you can then work locally should you wish to do so.</p>

<p>The biggest advantage of Quickoffice is that all of your files are saved in the native Microsoft Office format, so there is no need for conversion before submitting your work to your teachers.</p>

I know it has happened to a number of students this year and as a result has placed them under considerably more pressure to meet the assignment deadlines.</p>

<p>The unfortunate truth is that memory sticks are not invincible, they will inevitably stop working at some point. So the question is what is the best option available to you in order to make it easy to transport important files between home and college?</p>

<p>Fortunately recent changes the Internet filtering policy of the college have meant that students now have access to a range of new services, including cloud storage. This post will take you through the range of options you have and give you a brief overview of each.</p>

<h4 id="dropbox">Dropbox</h4>

<div style="float: left">  
    <img src='http://fccmediastudies.org.uk/content/images/site_images/dropboxicon.jpg' >
</div>

<p>Dropbox is a simple and until recently possibly one of the best options available if you wanted quick access to cloud storage. They offer a number of different storage tiers, starting with a free 2GB account (although there are various methods of getting some extra free space).</p>

<p>The biggest advantage of Dropbox is that many mobile apps can use it to sync your data, which means that your settings and information are always safe.</p>

<p><a href='https://www.dropbox.com/' >Sign up to Dropbox</a> </p>

<h4 id="onedrive">OneDrive</h4>

<div style="float: left">  
    <img src='http://fccmediastudies.org.uk/content/images/site_images/One_drive_icon.jpg' >
</div>

<p>OneDrive (formally known as Sky Drive) is Microsoft's cloud storage system. Again as with Dropbox they offer a number of different storage tiers, however their free plan starts with 7GB (although there are various methods of getting some extra free space). </p>

<p>OneDrive also provides you access to an online version of Office. While this is a cut-down version of the full office software, it will meet most students needs and will allow you to create Word, Excel and Powerpoint files.</p>

<p>It is also worth noting that many of you may already have a OneDrive account, if at any point you have created a Microsoft Live account for e-mail or the Xbox Live service - you should have access to a OneDrive account. Depending on when exactly you created that account, you maybe one of the lucky ones who have a 25GB storage allocation!</p>

<p><a href='https://onedrive.live.com/about/en-us/' >Sign up to OneDrive</a> </p>

<h4 id="googledrive">Google Drive</h4>

<div style="float: left">  
    <img src='http://fccmediastudies.org.uk/content/images/site_images/googledriveicon.jpg' >
</div>

<p>Google Drive offers the largest amount of free storage and with changes to their storage tiers recently also the cheapest option for gaining large amounts of online storage. Their free plan will give you access to 15GB of storage, which in most cases will be more than enough for any student. </p>

<p>However if you are looking to upload large quantities of photos and other important files on your drive ready to be used at school, you can upgrade your online storage to 100GB for just $1.99 a month.</p>

<p>As with OneDrive, Google Drive provides you with some other advantages, providing you with the ability to create a Document, Presentation or Spreadsheet. Once you have created these documents you can also download a Microsoft Office format version ready to submit to your teachers.</p>

<p><a href='https://drive.google.com/' >Sign up to Google Drive</a> </p>

<hr />

<p>Any one of these services will provide you with a robust storage system for your important files, they are of course dependent on the Internet but in truth you should find this to be a great deal more reliable then USB memory sticks and they can be accessed from virtually any device. </p>

<p>Please consider making the move to Cloud storage, either now or over the summer period ready for the new school year.</p>]]></description><link>http://fccmediastudies.org.uk/2014/05/27/cloud-storage-vs-memory-stick/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">35946bb8-74cb-40e5-af1d-1d6f04116f90</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Mr Manning]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 27 May 2014 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Fall Out Boy complete the Young Blood Chronicles]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>The musical film project, which started in February of 2013, has finished with the release of the final two music videos on Saturday 24th. There are a couple of things to consider about this project:</p>

<ul>
<li>This was a huge undertaking, releasing a music video for every song on an album is a rare event but there is a precedence of similar projects. During an interview with MTV Pete Wentz makes reference to Electroma by Daft Punk.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>“In some ways, we were inspired by Daft Punk’s <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daft_Punk%27s_Electroma' >"Electroma" film</a>, not literally inspired by it, but more the idea of the deceit within each of us that we have to uncover in the search for who we truly are,” Wentz wrote. “There will be a video for every song on the album … they’ll be able to be watched back-to-back and it will make sense if one has the stomach to sit through 11 FOB music videos in a row.”</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Just as with a television series, the entire project is an example of segmented narrative. Each video can be viewed as a standalone component but also as a whole.</li>
<li>It is an excellent example of promotion, especially when you consider that the original album was released over a year ago. Yet they have managed to keep up the interest by offering updates via social networking and their official website.</li>
<li>There are some interesting uses of intertextuality - I think the briefcase is a nice nod to Pulp Fiction.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can view all of the videos via the playlist below:</p>

<p>When we launched our Twitter feed a few months ago, we hoped it would increase our ability to communicate with our students; however now we want to take this further.</p>

<p>While the site will become fully operational from the beginning of the new school year, you can consider the next few months the beta testing phase.</p>

<p>While this website will not replace Moodle for assignment guidance and submission, it will act as the central hub for all of the information we want to share with you. It is going to be work in progress, so remember to let us know what you would like to see being put on the site.</p>

<p>You can always send us a message on <a href='http://www.twitter.com/fccmediastudies'  target="_blank">Twitter</a>, via <a href='mailto:media@felpham.org.uk' >E-mail</a> or just drop into the Media Centre for a chat.</p>]]></description><link>http://fccmediastudies.org.uk/2014/05/17/welcome/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">8ebe03ba-1e33-43d6-bb12-1091c2f8f1a8</guid><category><![CDATA[General]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Mr Manning]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 17 May 2014 12:54:43 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
