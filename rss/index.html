We still have a number of students who do not have access to a office suite either on their home Computer or their tablet device. So below I have put together an overview of the different software which is available to you.</p>

<h3 id="remoteaccesstofcc">Remote Access to FCC</h3>

<p>As of the beginning of November 2013, students have had access to the new Microsoft Remote Apps system. This system will successfully run on tablet devices and a range of browsers, from both inside the college and at home. </p>

<p>The Remote Apps system can be found by <a href='https://www.remote-felpham.co.uk/RDWeb' >clicking here</a> and following the instructions. The advantage of using this system is that you have access to your college workspace and a range of software you may not have access to at home i.e. Photoshop CS3. </p>

<h3 id="paidsoftware">Paid Software</h3>

<p><strong>Microsoft Office</strong> <br />
<em>Windows / Mac OS X</em></p>

<p>As part of the new Office 365, personal users can now buy a subscription of £5.99 a month or £59.99 per year. This subscription will allow you to install office on 1 PC or Mac, as well as 1 Tablet.</p>

<p>Alternatively you can sign up for the Office 365 subscription which is £7.99 a month or £79.99 per year. The advantage of the subscription is that it allows you to install office on up to 5 PCs or Macs, as well as 5 tablets.</p>

<p>Office 365 will provide you access to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Windows: Word, Excel, Powerpoint, Publisher, Access, OneNote and Outlook</li>
<li>Mac: Word, Excel, Powerpoint and Outlook</li>
</ul>

<p>By signing up to an Office 365 subscription you also gain an extra 20GB of OneDrive storage.</p>

<p><strong>iWork</strong> <br />
<em>Mac OS X / iOS</em></p>

<p>iWork is comprised of three main pieces of software: Pages, Keynote and Numbers, each of which received a major upgrade in October 2013. As well as being able to save your files in the native iWork format, you can also save in a Microsoft Office friendly format which makes it easy to continue working on a project on the college network.</p>

<p>iWork is available on:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mac: £13.99 each from the Mac App Store OR Free if you have purchased a new Mac since October 1st or own a previous version of iWork.</li>
<li>iOS: £6.99 each from the iTunes App Store OR Free if you have purchased a new iDevice since October 1st or own a previous version of an iWork app.</li>
</ul>

<p>Using iCloud all of your documents can by synced between your desktop and your mobile device (requires at least OS X 10.7 and iOS 6).</p>

<p><a href='http://www.apple.com/uk/creativity-apps/mac/' >Click here to visit the iWork website</a></p>

<h3 id="freesoftware">Free Software</h3>

<p><strong>OneDrive</strong> <br />
<em>Windows / Mac OS X</em></p>

<p>By signing up to an OneDrive account as well as gaining 7GB of online file storage, you also gain access to an online version of Office. While this is a cut-down version of the full office software, it will meet most students needs and will allow you to create Word, Excel and Powerpoint files.</p>

<p>It is important to note that while all of your documents will be stored online, you can download a offline version of your files ready to submit to your teachers.</p>

<p><a href='https://onedrive.live.com/about/en-us/' >Click here to visit the OneDrive sign up page</a></p>

<p><strong>Google Drive</strong> <br />
<em>Windows / Mac OS X / iOS / Android</em></p>

<p>By signing up to an Google Drive account you will gain 15GB of online storage and the ability to create a Document, Presentation or Spreadsheet. While Google Drive exists entirely online, the range of features which is provided to the user is extremely extensive and will easily meet the needs of almost every user.</p>

<p>If you use Google Chrome as your browser if provides you with the ability to setup offline access to your files and documents. You can also download a Microsoft Office format version of your documents ready to submit to your teachers. </p>

<p>There is also a Google Drive app available for iOS and Android devices, while they do allow you to edit your documents they only provide basic functionality. </p>

<p><a href='https://accounts.google.com/' >Click here to visit the Google Drive sign up page</a> <br />

<p><strong>iWork for iCloud</strong> <br />
<em>Windows / Mac OS X</em> </p>

<p>iWork Online is still classed as beta by Apple, so while there may still be some bugs to be ironed out, the range of functionality is extremely strong. All you need is an iCloud account which is available to anyone with an device running iOS 6 or higher. Any document you create in iWork Online is accessible via iWork on the Mac or iOS.</p>

<p>You can also e-mail a Microsoft Office format version of your document ready to submit to your teachers. Unlike SkyDrive and Google Drive, iCloud online IS accessible via the college internet.</p>

<p><a href='https://www.apple.com/iwork-for-icloud/' >Click here to visit the iWork for iCloud website</a></p>

<p><strong>OpenOffice 4.1 / LibreOffice 4.1</strong> <br />
<em>Windows / Mac OS X</em></p>

<p>OpenOffice is an open source office suite which provides a full range of different pieces of software including the ability to create documents, spreadsheets, presentations, drawings and databases. It allows for the user to save all of their files in a Microsoft Office format, however it is also worth noting that as of Microsoft Office 2010 all OpenOffice files types can be opened. </p>

<p>LibreOffice is an off-shoot of the OpenOffice project and offers many of the same features, along with the ability to open Publisher files. It is important to note that at the moment, you can only view Publisher files.</p>

<p><strong>Quickoffice</strong> <br />
<em>iOS / Android</em></p>

<p>Quickoffice is a free app for both iOS and Android, it allows you to open and edit Microsoft Office documents, spreadsheets and presentations. While it does require you to sign into a Google Drive account when run for the first time, you can then work locally should you wish to do so.</p>

<p>The biggest advantage of Quickoffice is that all of your files are saved in the native Microsoft Office format, so there is no need for conversion before submitting your work to your teachers.</p>

There are a couple of things to consider about this project:</p>

<ul>
<li>This was a huge undertaking, releasing a music video for every song on an album is a rare event but there is a precedence of similar projects. During an interview with MTV Pete Wentz makes reference to Electroma by Daft Punk.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>“In some ways, we were inspired by Daft Punk’s <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daft_Punk%27s_Electroma' >"Electroma" film</a>, not literally inspired by it, but more the idea of the deceit within each of us that we have to uncover in the search for who we truly are,” Wentz wrote. “There will be a video for every song on the album … they’ll be able to be watched back-to-back and it will make sense if one has the stomach to sit through 11 FOB music videos in a row.”</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Just as with a television series, the entire project is an example of segmented narrative. Each video can be viewed as a standalone component but also as a whole.</li>
<li>It is an excellent example of promotion, especially when you consider that the original album was released over a year ago. Yet they have managed to keep up the interest by offering updates via social networking and their official website.</li>
<li>There are some interesting uses of intertextuality - I think the briefcase is a nice nod to Pulp Fiction.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can view all of the videos via the playlist below:</p>

<p>When we launched our Twitter feed a few months ago, we hoped it would increase our ability to communicate with our students; however now we want to take this further.</p>

<p>While the site will become fully operational from the beginning of the new school year, you can consider the next few months the beta testing phase.</p>

<p>While this website will not replace Moodle for assignment guidance and submission, it will act as the central hub for all of the information we want to share with you. It is going to be work in progress, so remember to let us know what you would like to see being put on the site.</p>
